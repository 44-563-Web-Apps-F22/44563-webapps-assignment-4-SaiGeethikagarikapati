    <h3>Utopia Limited</h3>
    <h4>ACT II Throne Room in King Paramount's Palace</h4>

    <p>Zara: Why, Arthur, what does it matter? When the higher
        qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
        notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
        thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
        (demurely), you are not singing for an engagement (putting her
        hand in his), you have that already!</p>

    <p>Fitz.: How good and wise you are! How unerringly your
        practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
        material from the merely incidental!</p>

    <p>Zara: My Girton training, Arthur. At Girton all is wheat, and
        idle chaff is never heard within its walls! But tell me, is not
        all working marvelously well? Have not our Flowers of Progress
        more than justified their name?</p>

    <p>Fitz.: We have indeed done our best. Captain Corcoran and I
        have, in concert, thoroughly remodeled the sister-
        services—and upon so sound a basis that the South Pacific
        trembles at the name of Utopia!</p>

    <p>Zara: How clever of you!</p>

    <p>Fitz.: Clever? Not a bit. It's easy as possible when the
        Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere. And so
        with the others. Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
        idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
        full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
        never dreamt of!</p>

    <p>Zara: But perhaps the most beneficent changes of all has been
        ef-fected by Mr. Goldbury, who, discarding the exploded theory
        that some strange magic lies hidden in the number Seven, has
        applied the Limited Liability principle to individuals, and every
        man, woman, and child is now a Company Limited with liability
        restricted to the amount of his declared Capital! There is not a
        christened baby in Utopia who has not already issued his little
        Prospectus!</p>

    <p>Fitz.: Marvelous is the power of a Civilization which can
        trans-mute, by a word, a Limited Income into an Income Limited.</p>

    <p>Zara: Reform has not stopped here—it has been applied
        even to the costume of our people. Discarding their own barbaric
        dress, the natives of our land have unanimously adopted the taste-
        ful fashions of England in all their rich entirety. Scaphio and
        Phantis have undertaken a contract to supply the whole of Utopia
        with clothing designed upon the most approved English
        models—and the first Drawing-Room under the new state of
        things is to be held here this evening.</p>

    <p>Fitz.: But Drawing-Rooms are always held in the afternoon.</p>

    <p>Zara: Ah, we've improved upon that. We all look so much
        better by candlelight! And when I tell you, dearest, that my
        Court train has just arrived, you will understand that I am long-
        ing to go and try it on.</p>

    <p>Fitz.: Then we must part?</p>



    <p>Zara: Necessarily, for a time.</p>
