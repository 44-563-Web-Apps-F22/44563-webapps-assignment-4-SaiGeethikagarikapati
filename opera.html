    <h4>ACT II Throne Room in King Paramount's Palace</h4>

    <h4>ZAR:</h4><p> Why, Arthur, what does it matter? When the higher
        qualities of the heart are all that can be desired, the higher
        notes of the voice are matters of comparative insignificance. Who
        thinks slightingly of the cocoanut because it is husky? Be-sides
        (demurely), you are not singing for an engagement (putting her
        hand in his), you have that already!</p>

    <h4>FIT:</h4> <p>How good and wise you are! How unerringly your
        practiced brain winnows the wheat from the chaff—the
        material from the merely incidental!</p>

    <h4>ZAR:</h4><p> My Girton training, Arthur. At Girton all is wheat, and
        idle chaff is never heard within its walls! But tell me, is not
        all working marvelously well? Have not our Flowers of Progress
        more than justified their name?</p>

    <h4>KIN:</h4><p>Oh!  (Addressing them)  Gentlemen, our daughter holds
        her first Drawing-Room in half an hour, and we shall have time to
        make our half-yearly report in the interval.  I am neces-sarily
        unfamiliar with the forms of an English Cabinet
        Council—perhaps the Lord Chamberlain will kindly put us in
        the way of doing the thing properly, and with due regard to the
        solemnity of the occasion.</p>

    <h4>LOR.</h4><p>  Certainly—nothing simpler.  Kindly bring your
        chairs forward—His Majesty will, of course, preside.</p>

    <h4>ZAR</h4><p> Clever? Not a bit. It's easy as possible when the
        Admiral-ty and Horse Guards are not there to interfere. And so
        with the others. Freed from the trammels imposed upon them by
        idle Acts of Parliament, all have given their natural tal-ents
        full play and introduced reforms which, even in Eng-land, were
        never dreamt of!</p>

    

    <h4>CHO:</h4><p> Divorce is nearly obsolete in England.</p> 

   
    <h4>PHA:</h4><p>  Then our Burlesque Theater is absolutely ruined!</p>
