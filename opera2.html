    <h3>And the show goes on.</h3>
    <h4 class="name Zara">ZAR</h4><p>You probably know that we've contracted to supply the
        entire nation with a complete English outfit.  But perhaps you do
        not know that, when we send in our bills, our customers plead
        liability limited to a declared capital of eighteenpence, and
        apply to be dealt with under the Winding-up Actâ€”as in
        England?</p>
    <h4 class="name King">KIN</h4><p>  My daughters, we are about to attempt a very solemn
        ceremo-nial, so no giggling, if you please.  Now, my Lord Chamber-
        lain, we are ready. (LADY SOPHY much
        shocked.) </p>
        <h4 class="name Scaphio">SCA</h4><p>Then, ladies and gentlemen, places, if you please.  His
            Maj-esty will take his place in front of the throne, and will be
            so obliging as to embrace all the debutantes.  (LADY SOPHY much
            shocked.)</p>
